8 slices center-cut bacon, halved
1 ripe medium avocado
2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil
1 tablespoon mayonnaise
1/2 teaspoon finely grated or minced garlic
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground pepper
8 slices sprouted-wheat bread
1 medium tomato, cut into 8 slices

Cook bacon in a large skillet over medium heat until crisp, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.
Meanwhile, mash avocado in a medium bowl. Stir in basil, mayonnaise, garlic, salt and pepper. Toast bread.
Spread about 2 tablespoons of the avocado mixture on 4 slices of toast. Top each with 4 pieces of bacon, 2 tomato slices, 1 lettuce leaf, 1/4 cup sprouts and the remaining toast.
